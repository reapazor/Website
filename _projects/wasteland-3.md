During the production of WL3, when inXile needed a new lead engineer for the project, with deadlines looming, Unity recommended me (yes — that’s literally how it happened) to get them out of their bind.

After having worked previously with the studio and having done some moonlighting on WL2, the chance to work on optimization and console development for the title was an easy yes.

## Highlights

- Mentoring and educating some awesome developers.
- Designed and implemented a managed update system.
- Refactor game systems into task/job-based solutions.
- Created best practices for optimized rendering and gameplay systems.
- Collaboratively designed and developed an automated texture management system.
- Identified and corrected bottlenecks with Wwise implementation.
- Developed robust gameplay tooling for game designers.
- Constructed efficient build pipelines supporting multiple platforms.
